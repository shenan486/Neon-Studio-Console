		<h5>This Is A Website Made For Anybody To See Our Projects. If You Are Reading This...... WHY?......HUH?......YOU LOST OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?.....HUH?Anyways, Jokes Aside, Let's Talk A Little.My Name Is Shenan And I Am The Leader Of Neon Studio. If You Think This Website is Kind Of Cringe Or Awkward Then Don't Worry. When I Made This I Was 13 Years Old. I Am Not Expecting That Our Studio Goes Viral Or Something Like That. This Was Made For Fun By My Friends. But The Projects Are Real. I Am The Website Designer And My Other Friends Are The Ones That Give Me Ideas And Make The Applications And Stuff, But The Software Riptile Was Made By Me. It Was Created In Batch And I Converted It Into EXE. I Don't Know If It Works But I Just Kept It There To Remind Us What We Accomplished. If You Read This Whole Thing, Thanks! :)</h5>
